## 🌈Introduction

I love rainbow, and I love this colorful world.

This is a blog build for reprensenting me in some ways, so I want to make sure it is as unique as possible. 

I decide to divide it into 6 section :

- 👼About me 
- 🔮Tech notes 
- 🌸Entertainments
- 🐣Compulsory courses 
- 📘Literature
- 🌱Footprints 

  and each section has a different theme color，hope I can gradully build it up !
